# Language Models: Resources For Business
üëã Welcome to this repository that hosts a curated dataset of NLP-based tools for business!

This dataset was produced as a part of my Master's Thesis work at emlyon business school in November-December 2022. Its goal is to contribute to the global community of NLP enthusiasts, from researchers and practitioners to students. Anyone interested in applications of language models for business is welcome to leverage this repository and contribute more resources to it.

‚û°Ô∏è [Click here to access the repo ‚¨ÖÔ∏è](https://github.com/viktoriiapoliakova/Language-Models-Resources-For-Business/blob/main/repository-of-resources.md)

It is organized by several categories based on the types of applications and resources collected (e.g. Content Creation, Code Generation, Document Processing, etc.) 

This list is by no means exhaustive. It highlights some of the great tools and resources available out there, but there is so much more out there that deserves to be highlighted.

### How to contribute?
