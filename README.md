# Language Models: Resources For Business
Welcome to this repository that hosts a curated dataset of NLP-based tools for business.

This dataset was produced as a part of my Master's Thesis work in November-December 2022. Its goal is to contribute to the global community of NLP enthusiasts, from researchers and practitioners to students. Anyone interested in applications of language models for business is welcome to leverage this repository and contribute more resources to it. Don't hesitate to suggest additional categories and/or tools via pull requests.

I hope that in this repository you find something useful today.
